# DSPatula

The goal of this project is to work through Richard G Lyons's excellent "Understanding Digital Signal Processing" book and provide high-performance, well-tested, idiomatic Java example code to go along with each chapter in the book.

This is very much a work in progress.  The primary goal is to help myself in understanding DSP (something I didn't learn in my CS courses), with the secondary goal of helping other people who either also want to learn DSP, want a Java reference to go along with Lyons's book, or who have a need of doing some simple Java DSP work.

I hope to take some of my experience with Java concurrency to ensure that every example will take advantage of as many cores as are offered by the platform, while still attempting to be sure that the examples are clear in expressing intention in the code.

It is also my aim to ensure that ample unit tests exist, because correctness is of course very important to DSP work, and often unit tests are an excellent way of expressing one's intention.
